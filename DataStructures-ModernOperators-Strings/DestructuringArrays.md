## Remembering Array Destructuring

To effectively utilize array destructuring in your JavaScript code, memorize these key points:

1. **Square Brackets Denote Destructuring:** Array destructuring is initiated and concluded using square brackets `[]`.

2. **Variable Names Correspond to Array Elements:** Specify the names of the variables you want to extract, aligning them with the positions of the corresponding array elements.

3. **Trailing Commas Bypass Extra Elements:** Employ trailing commas to skip or ignore remaining elements in an uneven array, enhancing code readability.

4. **Destructuring Embraces Nested Structures:** Array destructuring extends to nested arrays and objects, enabling efficient extraction of data from intricate data structures.
